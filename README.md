# Color Detection With Python

In this project, I develop a Color Detection System to detect color 'green' from any object using Open CV.


### Project Steps
- Define the color ranges.
- Develop the color detection function.
- Connect your local device camera to the OpenCV Window.


## Code
You can find the code for this project here.

File overview:
- `Color Detector.py` - a jupyter notebook that contains all of the code.



## Data
- The Internet Mifi waved at the camera.


## Demo
